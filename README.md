# Melting-curve-Tm-analysis

Description:
This code is to analyze melting temperature of each gene analyzed our the course time. In a service laboratory it is crucial to maintain the quality of service provided, as such routine QC analysis must be conducted.

This melting curve analysis show consistency/inconsistency of gene amplifications over course of time. It is specially important in high-throughput service labs testing 100â€™s of genes per run and with high turnover of samples. 

The melting curve analysis is also used for mutation analysis.
